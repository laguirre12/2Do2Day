    <h1> About</h1>
    <p> Touday(too-day) is a webpage that gives users advice on what to do for a particular event.
      The webpage also gives the user the freedom to add advice to the website for others to see.</p>
    <p> For example, if the user is at work. They can click work, and an advice would pop up on the screen.
      The user can either take that advice or click the refresh button that would show a different advice.</p>
    <p>This webpage is used to get people out of their comfort zone and motivate them to try new things. </p>
    <p>
    Touday is meant to help people get out of their comfort zones, and being that there can be many different actions we feel
    that a user should be able to add a suggestion. However, they must follow the Rules for posting suggestions:
    <br></br>

    <article id="rules">
      - No usage of profanities/curse words (whatever you want to call them).<br></br>
      - The suggestions must be relevant to the specific category. <br></br>
      - The suggestions should be meant to help people, and, thus, cannot have any hurtful comments targeting either a specific group or a user.<br></br>
      - Special characters will not be allowed in posts. If a post has certain special characters it will not be added as a suggestion. (e.g. â€œ{ } < > * @, etc.)
        If it is not added as a suggestion you will not see the message you inputed after clicking "submit."
    </article>
    </p>

    <p> Touday was created as a project during Google CSSI (Cambridge) 2015. We would like to thank our instructors, our TA's, Kim Stabile, and Andrew McHugh for helping
      us create this project. Feel free to look around our website and contribute suggestions (just follow the rules!!!).
